ðŸ“‡ Contact Identification Service
A RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to identify and link user contacts based on email and/or phone number, following specific deduplication rules.

ðŸ”§ This project is part of a task submission where a new contact is created as "primary", and all subsequent matches with new info are created as "secondary" and linked to the original.

ðŸ§  How It Works
If no existing contact is found â†’ create a new primary contact

If email or phone number matches an existing contact, but the other field is new â†’ create a secondary contact and link it to the primary

All related contacts are grouped together using linkedId and linkPrecedence
